Handler:Hey, let's focus up, 'kay?
Handler:If you want to talk to me, use the <i>Unbreakable Knot</i>. I can't really hear you otherwise, so let's keep the chatter to a minimum, yeah?

Handler:Great. Okay, the entrance should be hidden somewhere nearby. Poke around, see if you can find it.
Player:POKE I SHALL. AND ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES POKING, I SHALL CLICK WITH MY *<i>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON*</i>.
Player:INDEED, *<i>LEFT MOUSE BUTTON</i>*. NOT THE *RIGHT*. THAT DOES SOMETHING <i>DIFFERENT</i>.
