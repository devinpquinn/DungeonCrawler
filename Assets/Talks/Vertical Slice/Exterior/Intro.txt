Player:VERILY, MUCH ALIKE-- SAVE WHERE I ONCE DODDERED, NOW I STRUT, DARESAY.
Handler:That's super, bud, really great-- but let's focus up, 'kay?
Handler:Can you still hear me all right? Is your earpiece nice and secure?
Player:YES. I HAVE PLACED IT INSIDE MY HELMET LIKE YOU YELLED AT ME TO DO.
Player:AND MY VOICE, IT IS BEING TRANSMITTED TO YOU?
Handler:It-- yes. Extremely. Oh my god, it is echoing so loud and so bad. Just.. straight up all caps.
Handler:Okay, the entrance should be hidden somewhere nearby. Poke around, see if you can find it.
Player:POKE I SHALL. AND ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES POKING, I SHALL CLICK WITH MY [jitter=6 angle=1]*LEFT MOUSE BUTTON*[/jitter].
Player:INDEED, THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON! NOT THE RIGHT. THAT DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
