[title=gate-opened-start]
The gate swings open less than smoothly, its hinges creaking in the damp night air. In my efforts, I snap off the key in the old lock.{openGate}
Handler:Nice.

[title=gate-advice-start]
Handler:Use the key, you lump.
Handler:It's in your stuff. Press *Tab* to open and close your inventory (out of dialogue) and click on an item to equip it.

----------SHOVEL----------

[title=shovel-first-start]
An old, somewhat rusty, short-handled shovel. Besides digging up berry bushes, this could also be useful for excavating secret passages.
{@shovel}

[title=shovel-start]
Player:[expression=?][question=q]
[choice]Take the shovel.<took-shovel>
[choice][?=item:Unbreakable Knot][Unbreakable Knot] Could this be a trap?<shovel-advice>

[title=shovel-end]

[title=shovel-advice-start]
Player:THIS DISCARDED TOOL SEEMS ALMOST TOO CONVENIENT. 
Player:[expression=?]PERHAPS IT IS TRAPPED, AND THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD WILL RISE TO NIP AT MY HEELS AS SOON AS I TOUCH IT.
Handler:Stop being ridiculous. We don't need to worry about traps until you actually get underground.
Handler:...I think.
{@shovel}
[title=shovel-advice-end]

[title=took-shovel-start]
I pull the shovel from the earth and tuck it securely beneath my capacious cloak.{tookShovel}

[title=obol-knot-start]
Handler:Yep, that's the one. The way in should be right beneath your feet.
[title=obol-knot-end]

[title=obol-notes-start]
Player:IT IS INDEED A MATCH. THIS, THEN, IS THE STONE THAT MARKS THE WAY.
[title=obol-notes-end]

[title=obol-shovel-start]
Player:SHALL I?
Handler:You shall.
The earth around this stone is firm, but the trapdoor, as I soon discover, is not buried deep. {dug}
My shovel cracks through the old, soggy wood covering a cylindrical pit. A ladder of uncertain length leads down into the darkness.
