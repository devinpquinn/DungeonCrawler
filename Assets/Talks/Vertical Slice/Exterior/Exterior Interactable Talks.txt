----------GATE----------

[title=gate-no-item-start]
A point of passage through an insurmountably thigh-high barrier.
(I have the key to this gate in my inventory. While not in dialogue, *Tab* opens and closes my inventory.)
(Click on an item in my inventory to equip it. Having a context-appropriate item equipped may give me special options in dialogue.)

[title=gate-item-end]

[title=gate-opened-start]
The gate swings open less than smoothly, its hinges creaking in the damp night air. In my efforts, I snap off the key in the old lock.{openGate}
<i>[Item lost - Iron Key.]</i>
Handler:Nice.
[title=gate-opened-end]

[title=gate-advice-start]
Handler:Use the key, you lump.
Handler:It's in your stuff. Press *Tab* to open and close your inventory (out of dialogue) and click on an item to equip it.

----------SHOVEL----------

[title=shovel-first-start]
An old, somewhat rusty, short-handled shovel. Besides digging up berry bushes, this could also be useful for excavating secret passages.
{@shovel}
[title=shovel-first-end]

[title=shovel-start]
Player:[expression=?][question=q]
[choice]Take the shovel.<took-shovel>
[choice][?=item:Unbreakable Knot]Could this be a trap?<shovel-advice>
[choice]Step away.
[title=shovel-end]

[title=shovel-advice-start]
Player:THIS DISCARDED TOOL SEEMS ALMOST TOO CONVENIENT. 
Player:[expression=?]PERHAPS IT IS TRAPPED, AND THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD WILL RISE TO NIP AT MY HEELS AS SOON AS I TOUCH IT.
Handler:Stop being ridiculous. We don't need to worry about traps until you actually get underground.
Handler:...I think.
{@shovel}
[title=shovel-advice-end]

[title=took-shovel-start]
I pull the shovel from the earth and tuck it securely beneath my capacious cloak.{tookShovel}

----------OBOL----------

[title=obol-first-start]
"OBOL - May you pass safely across night's river to the shores beyond."

[choice]Step away.
[title=obol-end]

[title=obol-knot-start]
Handler:Yep, that's the one. The way in should be right beneath your feet.
[title=obol-knot-end]

[title=obol-notes-start]
Player:IT IS INDEED A MATCH. THIS, THEN, IS THE STONE THAT MARKS THE WAY.
[title=obol-notes-end]

[title=obol-shovel-start]
Player:SHALL I?
Handler:You shall.
The earth around this stone is firm, but the trapdoor, as I soon discover, is not buried deep. {dug}
My shovel cracks through the old, soggy wood covering a cylindrical pit. A ladder of uncertain length leads down into the darkness.
[title=obol-shovel-end]

----------OBOL----------

----------HOLE----------

[title=hole-first-start]
The ladder, and absolute blackness, awaits.
{@hole}
[title=hole-first-end]

[title=hole-start]
Player:[expression=?][question=q]
[choice]Descend. <down>
[choice]Step away from the beckoning dark.

----------HOLE----------

----------HOLLOW TREE----------

[title=tree-first-start]
A pair of beady eyes looks out at me from within the trunk of this gnarled tree.
The creature that lives here is shaped like an owl. It hoots, softly. A sound perfectly resembling that which an owl might make.
{checkTreeItem}
[title=tree-first-end]

[title=tree-no-item-start]
The owl-shaped creature is hungry.
[title=tree-no-item-end]

Player:[expression=?][question=q]

[choice][?=item:Trail Mix]Offer my trail mix. <tree-fed>
[choice][?=item:Bitter Berries]Offer berries. <tree-berries>
[choice]Leave the creature be.
[title=tree-end]

[title=tree-knot-start]
Player:THERE IS A LITTLE FELLOW IN HERE. JUST A LITTLE FELLOW.
Handler:Leave it. Could be a lookout, for all we know.
[title=tree-knot-end]

[title=tree-fed-start]
I offer what morsels of food I have to the owlish form in the darkness. It snaps them gratefully from my gloved palm with a satisfied chirrup.{owlItem}
In return, it hacks up a mangled wad of fur and tiny bones. Loath to refuse this gift, I squelch it into my pocket.
Player:A FAIR AND JUST EXCHANGE, O CREATURE.
<i>[Item lost - Trail Mix.]</i>
<i>[Item added - "Owl" Pellet.]</i>
[title=tree-fed-end]

[title=tree-berries-start]
The creature recoils violently from the handful of berries I proffer, hissing.
In its panic to retreat into the bowels of the tree, it hacks up a mangled wad of fur and tiny bones.
<i>[Item added - "Owl" Pellet.]</i> {owlItem}
[title=tree-berries-end]

----------HOLLOW TREE----------

----------BERRY BUSH----------

[title=berries-start]
Small scarlet berries stipple this scraggly shrub.
{@berries-q}
[title=berries-end]

[title=berries-q-start]
Player:[expression=?][question=q]
[choice][?=item:Unbreakable Knot]Ask about berries. <berries-knot>
[choice]Pick a few berries. <took-berries>
[choice]Step away.
[title=berries-q-end]

[title=berries-knot-start]
Handler:Careful. Those might be poisonous.
Handler:Wait... you don't even eat--
{@berries-q}
[title=berries-knot-end]

[title=took-berries-start]
I swiftly pluck and pocket a juicy handful. {berryItem}
Handler:Why?
Player:TO HAVE.

----------BERRY BUSH----------

----------BERRY BENCH & BUSH HOLE----------

[title=berry-bench-start]
The plaque on this bench reads - "G + N - May these modest brambles bear fruit such as our love has borne."
[title=berry-bench-end]

[title=bush-hole-start]
This bush, once fruitful, has been dug up. Not even the roots remain.
[title=bush-hole-end]

----------BERRY BENCH & BUSH HOLE----------

----------STUMP BENCH----------

[title=stump-bench-start]
The plaque on this bench reads - "<s>Agnes</s> Maisie - Let these sturdy oaks stand firm together as we shall, always."
Neither tree is an oak.
[title=stump-bench-end]

----------STUMP BENCH----------

----------MOUSEOLEUM----------

[title=maus-start]
This structure is too small for me to enter, but my gaze starkly illuminates its innards, walls lined with tiny recesses.
It is the burial hall of dozens of beloved rodents-- a "Mouse-oleum," if you will.
Player:I WILL NOT. 
{checkMaus}
[title=maus-end]

[title=maus-q-start]
Player:[expression=?][question=q]
[choice][?=item:Unbreakable Knot]Report in. <maus-knot>
[choice]Step away.
[title=maus-q-end]

[title=maus-knot-start]
Player:COULD THE PASSAGE WE SEEK LIE WITHIN?
Handler:If you don't see anything that matches our notes, keep looking. Tempting, though.

"RORY - My sausage-shaped lad. Friend to all, bane of squirrels."

[title=tomb-2-start]
"BUCKET - Though our time together was brief, I will always remember you."
[title=tomb-2-end]

[title=tomb-3-start]
What markings this headstone bore are illegible, eroded away by time and weather. Only the love remains.
[title=tomb-3-end]
