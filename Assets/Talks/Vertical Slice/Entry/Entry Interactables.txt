----------LADDER----------

[title=ladder-start]
The surprisingly long ladder spears upward into a tiny circle of night sky still visible above.
Its damp old wood is rotten, and suffered greatly upon my descent, cracking and creaking mightily. I will not be able to return this way, nor climb the earthen shaft by other measures.
Player:HOW CONVENIENTLY INCONVENIENT.
[title=ladder-end]

[title=ladder-again-start]
A timeworn ladder, too decrepit to climb.

----------STORAGE----------

[title=storage-start]
Crates, barrels, vases and urns, caked with undisturbed dust.
Each and every container is filled with pale, fine-grained sand.
Player:NOTHING.
Handler:Shame. I was really hoping our Wish would be just sitting in a box in the first chamber.
Player:<i>OUR</i> WISH?

[title=storage-again-start]
Rubbish. Vessels of sand.
